#For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts to be read in their meetings : the breathings of a prisoner for the testimony of Jesus, who in the deep hath seen the afflictions of his people, and cannot hide his praise who support them, nor-with-hold his complaint because of the hardness of mens hearts, but cryes unto the Lord God of righteous judgment, for the deliverance of his own people : with a few words of exhortation and advice, given forth as a testimony of my dearest love to the whole seed of God, because I cannot otherwise communicate it in this time of my restraint, I have been the more large, that I may be refreshed with you, and you with me, in the overflowing fountain of our life / by John Whitehead.#
