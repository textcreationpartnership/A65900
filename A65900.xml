         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O Vineyard of the Mo≈øt High, wherein I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured according to the ability which God hath given me ≈øince the appearing of the Bright and Morning-Star which hath enlightned the World, in who≈øe Joy I am now at re≈øt, and my Peace is as a River, becau≈øe I hid not my Talent in the Earth, nor have ≈øtood idle in the Market-place, but have improved what was given me for my Ma≈øter's u≈øe; and for the increa≈øe and watering of thee his Vineyard, which I cannot in any wi≈øe forget now when trouble is near, and all the Bea≈øts of the Field do compa≈øs thee about, and with their whole Power do ≈øeek to break down thy Hedge, crop off thy Leaves, devour thy Fruit, tread under thy tender Plants, cut off thy flouri≈øhing Branches, and make thee as a Wilderne≈øs: For in the everla≈øting Love of one God I think upon thee, remembring the kindne≈øs of thy youth, and the love of thine E≈øpou≈øals, wherein thou wert betrothed to the Lord with Judgment and Mercy, in the day that thou ≈øate ≈øolitary in the Wilderne≈øs, and had none to help: my heart is broken within me, and doth with thy breathing Babes and tender Mourners (who≈øe Cry hath reached unto Heaven) ≈øend forth the≈øe <hi>Breathings,</hi> that in the Spirit of Supplication we may have fellow≈øhip together, whil≈øt my ≈øoul ≈øaith unto God, Surely thou ha≈øt no ca≈øt off the Beloved of thy Soul, nor ≈øold the Heritage (to be trodden down) for a thing of nought, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given the Plants of thine own right-hand for a ≈øpoil to their Enemies: Shall they then prevail, which come gna≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their teeth to devour us? and wilt thou let thy Name be bla≈øphemed, wherein thou ha≈øt gathered us, in which we do tru≈øt? for thy Pre≈øence is yet among≈øt us, and thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde≈øt not the Riches of thy Mercy from us, but opene≈øt thy Trea≈øure to us; and of thy Fulne≈øs we have received ≈øtrength, el≈øe we could not have e≈øcaped in the hour of Temptation, nor

But why do≈øt thou not ≈øhew thy ≈øelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, for they under≈øtand not thy way? For, though thou ha≈øt given thy Light into the World, they love Darkne≈øs rather, and that blinds their eyes, that they know not thee, nor us whom thou ha≈øt ≈øent, and therefore do per≈øecute and ≈øeek to root up, not believing that we are thy plea≈øant Plants; although thou ha≈øt created us anew in thine own Image, and ≈øhewed thy Light, Life, Love, Vertue, Power, Patience and good-will towards men, through us, yet do they not con≈øider, but think they do thee good ≈øervice, when they kill us all the day long: And when we do ≈øpeak to them in thy Name, and would turn them from their Envie, Anger, Pride, Covetou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Murders, Thefts, Lies, Adulteries, Fornications, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions, Inju≈øtice, and the evil of their Inventions, unto the Light wherein thy Fulne≈øs dwells, that therein they might walk with thee in newne≈øs of life; They reject our Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ≈øay we would delude them; and when we do declare thy Righteou≈øne≈øs, and ≈øhew thy Judgments at hand, becau≈øe Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions are multiplied, and Iniquity drunk up as water; their hearts they harden again≈øt us, and mock at fear, neither do they prepare to turn unto thee, but for our love in warning them, give us the water a Affliction to drink; and when we call them that are yet wandring with a heart panting for living water (but being gone a≈øtray from thy wayes, do drink of the Whores Cup, or, at be≈øt, that Water which men have fouled with their feet) and ≈øay, Turn ye again to the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file not your ≈øelves with the Inventions of men, neither touch any unclean thing, but come forth and <hi>be ye ≈øeparate,</hi> and our God will be a Father unto you, and you ≈øhall be his Children: Then they reproach us a <hi>factious, ≈øowers of Sedition:</hi> but if any do lay it to heart, and believe our Te≈øtimony and return, they meet them fir≈øt with flatteries, then with threats and cruelties, which they ≈øpread, as the ≈ønares on <hi>Mizpah,</hi> for their feet, like

            <p>But Friends, becau≈øe all of you that are convinced are not yet come into the ≈øavoury Life, to di≈øcern of things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, you mu≈øt ≈øake heed of pre≈øuming to judge of things that are, beyond your mea≈øure, for your principle, ≈øtrength and ≈øafety is to be ≈øtill, and wait in he Light of the Spirit <hi>within,</hi> that both your Faith and Wi≈ødom from above may be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and that will open you more and more to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, but will never let you ≈ølight nor reject the Spirit's Te≈øtimony in the Elders and Brethren, whom God did u≈øe as In≈øtruments to turn yow unto him, which ≈øtill in the ≈øame. Love do watch over your Souls; Neither ≈øhall you de≈øpi≈øe Prophe≈øying, not quench the Spirit that ≈øpeaks in the mouth of Babes who are of ≈øtammeting lips; but as Friends of the Bridegroom, rejoyce to hear his Voice in any in≈øtrument, by whom, or to whom never he ≈øpeaks<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But take diligent heed le≈øt you ≈øet tip any In≈øtrument above its place, or give unto it any part of the Glory that is due unto him that u≈øeth it, le≈øt thereby ye kindle his Wrath, and cau≈øe jealou≈øie to burn like a Fire: for if his Glory he given to, and received by the mo≈øt precious In≈øtrument in his hand, be will ca≈øt it away from him, and ≈øuffer it to be trodden under foot as the mire of the ≈øtreets.

            <p>And if Contention, Strife, Wars, or Commotions do ari≈øe in the Earth, betwixt Man and Man, or People and People where you inhabit, dwell you in that Power which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed you out of the Earth from among≈øt Men, and that will keep you ≈øen≈øible that you are not your own, but bought with a price, <hi>that you may be unto God a peculiar People;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ≈øhall not defile your ≈øelves with their Contentions, nor ≈øtrive, nor ≈øide with Parties, which fly to that Sword for refuge by which they may peri≈øh: but we having received and tru≈øted in the Sword of the Spirit, by which we can never peri≈øh, let us ≈øit down in that which keeps holy and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, and ≈øeparate from ≈øinners; ≈øo ≈øhall his wonderful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel,

            </p>
            <p>And you that are as yet not much exerci≈øed with Sufferings, but are at peace in your dwellings, none making you afraid, Take heed le≈øt at any time you be ≈øecure; for then may the Enemy intice you from a ≈øence of God's mercy to look out at Creatures, and to ≈øet your heart on Earthly things, and then if a tryal come ≈øuddenly and unexpected, it will be the heavier upon you; and if through want of preparation ye fall under in it, then it will be hard for you to be rai≈øed up again to ≈øtand faithful unto the End, whereon your ≈øafety and the po≈ø≈øde≈ø≈øion of the Crown of Life depends: and if you be not con≈øtant and faithful in the≈øe la≈øt tryals, you lo≈øe your reward, for all that ye have gone through: for, if any do put his hand to the plough, and look back, my ≈øoul hath no plea≈øure in him, ≈øaith the Lord. Therefore, as I would that you ≈øhould not be di≈ømaid, nor fear the Threatnings, Excommunications, Fines and Impri≈øonments, or any other thing which you may ≈øuffer by the wicked hands of mortal men; So would I that you may both inwardly and outwardly be prepared to ≈øuffer what man can do unto you: And whil≈øt ye behold the Lord re≈øtraining their wrath from breaking out again≈øt you, bear a part with your Brethren that are ≈øuffering under it, and God ≈øhall reckon it to you in the day of your need.</p>
            <p>Finally, dear Friends and Brethren, be of one mind, and live in peace, and in the Name of the Lord keep your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that Love and Life may abound among≈øt you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in faithfully in≈øtruct, admoni≈øh, and (if need be) reprove one another; but let the Spirit judge all things, and with an open tender heart receive In≈øtruction and Reproof one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pondring it in deep ≈øilence, and not mea≈øuring it in the rea≈øoning part, for that will grow high and work prejudice again≈øt the Admoni≈øher and Reprover, if you ≈øee not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent cau≈øe or need of ≈øuch a thing, and thereby you may both hurt your ≈øelves, and di≈øcourage tho≈øe that in ≈øincerity ≈øought your good, whereby they may be cau≈øed in ≈øilence to lament when they ≈øee you in the like danger, and ≈øay, <hi>We called, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59061:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>they would not hear:</hi> therefore mea≈øure and bear all things in the meek low ≈øpirit. And you that are ≈øtrong and ≈øpiritually minded, being come over all the≈øe things, labour to re≈øtore and rai≈øe up them that fall, and comfort the feeble-minded, and ≈øay to them that ≈øtand afar off, Draw near and walk with us in the Light, and the Lord will al≈øo give you re≈øt; and wait on your Mini≈øtry, that ye may pre≈øerve that which is gathered in the ≈øavoury Life, to ≈øhine as Lights before men; For there is a Seed ≈øown in this Nation and el≈øewhere, which begins to bud forth in thou≈øands, who having not ≈øeen, yet love; which gives me ≈øufficient ground to believe that when the Winter is pa≈øt, and the latter Rain comes upon the Earth, the ≈øhall be a plentiful Harve≈øt, wherein every one that hath been faithful in a little, ≈øhall reap much, and give thanks unto God which hath ble≈ø≈øed the Seed ≈øown, who will ≈øend forth ≈øuch, as in the furnace of Affliction he hath fitted for his u≈øe, faithfully to labour, that every eye may be opened to ≈øee the common Salvation (that God hath prepared for all People) is the Light that doth enlighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of <hi>I≈ørael.</hi>
